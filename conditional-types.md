### Conditional types
Excellent. Now we are starting to get into the more esoteric yet highly practical aspects of TypeScript's type system. 

The idea of conditional type is chiefly, "if a condition is met, the type shall be a specific type, else it will be a different type."

Since we're running on rocket fuel at this point, we'll just straight into commented examples to illustrate this.

```TypeScript
type conditionalType = ;
```
