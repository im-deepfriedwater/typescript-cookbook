# Help me install

Sure! It's quite easy and I'll tell you how to do it. Most commonly, people install TypeScript as a Node.js package to compile (or more specifically _transpile_) from the command-line. 




To compile a TypeScript file:
`tsc cookingsomethinggood.ts`

That's it! Note when you compile a file TypeScript automatically creates a `built` folder with corresponding JavaScript files and folders. Don't forget that in the end TypeScript compiles to JavaScript. We can change the output directory and various other settings by modifying a file called `tsconfig.json`, but don't worry we'll get to that in the next section!

"Wait this page is so short." 

Yup. Leveraging modern development workflows tends to do that to development environment installations.
