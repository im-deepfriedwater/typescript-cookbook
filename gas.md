### Now we're cooking with rocket fuel!
At this point if you were following chronologically, you should have a usable feel for how to use TypeScript. The following sections will be about more advanced topics which exemplify the extensive scope and power TypeScript has.

We will be diving in, and each topic should have enough examples for you to understand how these features might be used.

Enjoy the rocket fuel!
