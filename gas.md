### Now we're cooking with rocket fuel!
At this point if you were following chronologically, you should have a usable feel for how to use TypeScript. The following sections will be about more advanced topics which exemplify the extensive scope and power TypeScript has.

We will be diving in, and examples will be provided along the way to help illuminate the purpose and use of these cool features TypeScript has.

Enjoy the rocket fuel!
