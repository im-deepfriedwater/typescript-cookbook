# Just a TypeScript Cookbook
A quick recipe book to get started with TypeScript! The following cookbook assumes that you (the reader) are familiar with coding at least with a high-level programming language. Here I will write purposeful prose in an attempt to provide a helpful resource for anyone interested in getting cooking with TypeScript.  All the meanwhile, I will be hoping to learn a thing or two myself as I write this thing. How wholesome.

Let's get started shall we? Feel free to click along the table of contents in order. Or click chaotically, letting entropy dictate your fate.
