### Useful links and works cited

These are all awesome resources I've used for you to poke around for more TypeScript resources / something more useful than this cookbook.

- Ray Toal's TypeScript Notes [link](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introtypescript/)
    - My mentor for this TypeScript foray and all-around awesome university professor at LMU! As a plus he *loves* programming languages so you can tell these notes are going to be great.
- Official TypeScript Documentation [link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
    - Sometimes all you want is information straight from the creators themselves.
- Marius Schluz's Blog on New TypeScript Features [link](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/)
    - Concise and quick posts about new and useful features in TypeScript. Gives a lot of practical examples as well.
- Hejlsberg's What's New in TypeScript 2018 Talk [video](https://youtu.be/hDACN-BGvI8)
    - Fantastic talk on TypeScript from one of the heads of the TypeScript team himself. Gives a quick introduction, examples of using TypeScript features in production, and how they address some interesting theoretical problems.
- A more general discussion of type inference [link](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/type-inference/)
    - Not directly related to TypeScript but a great explanation of Hindley-Milner type inference to continue the topic of type inference.
